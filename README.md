## Introduction

The word “immune” means totally or partially resistant, and the word “checkpoint” means a passage that regulates inflow and outflow. According to WHO, cancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body, and/or spread to other organs. We can then define Immune Checkpoint in cancer as a passage or mechanism that regulates the resistance of the immune system to cancer cells, involving the control of immune response inflow and outflow. In cancer, this checkpoint refers to processes that can either partially or totally inhibit the immune system's ability to target and destroy abnormal cells that grow uncontrollably and invade other parts of 
the body.

## Case Study- T Cells

Immune checkpoints activate when proteins on the surface of immune cells called T cells recognize and bind to partner proteins on other cells, such as some tumour cells. These proteins are called immune checkpoint proteins. When the checkpoint and partner proteins bind together, they send an “off” signal to the T cells. 


## T Cell Activation

T cells are generated in the Thymus and are programmed to be specific for one particular foreign particle (antigen). Once they leave the thymus, they circulate throughout the body until they recognise their antigen on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). The T cell receptor (TCR) on both CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells binds to the antigen as it is held in a structure called the MHC complex, on the surface of the APC. This triggers initial activation of the T cells.

## Suppressing T Cell Activation

 The MHC-TCR interaction together with B7-1/2-CD28 interaction stimulates T-cell activation. On the contrary, CTLA-4 binds to B7-1/2 and mediates inhibitory signals to prevent T-cell activation. There are at least five interacting molecules in the PD pathway: PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7-1 (CD80), and RGM-2. PD-L1 and PD-L2 are ligands of PD-1, and the PD-L1/PD-L2 binding with PD-1 leads to suppression of T-cell activation. PD-L1 also interacts with B7-1 (CD80) on activated T-cells to inhibit T-cell activity. PD-L2 has its second receptor RGM-2. The PD-L2-RGM-2 interaction mediates respiratory tolerance.
